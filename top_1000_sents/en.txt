President of Ghana ( 2017–present ) Further information : Presidency of Nana Akufo-Addo Inauguration Akufo-Addo took office on 7 January 2017 .
His inauguration was held at Black Star Square in Accra .
Twelve presidents from African and European countries attended the ceremony , including Edgar Lungu of Zambia , Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt , Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone , Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe , Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria .
Akufo-Addo faced backlash , especially on social media , for plagiarizing parts of his inauguration speech , having lifted passages , word-for-word , from previous inaugural addresses given by American presidents John F. Kennedy , Bill Clinton and George W. Bush as well as prepared remarks given by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari at a 2015 United States Institute of Peace event .
After the scandal came to light , his press office issued an apology , with his communication director describing the situation as a 'complete oversight and never deliberate . '
However , after the mea culpa , it was found that Akufo-Addo had also plagiarized portions of his 2013 concession speech after the Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the 2012 electoral victory of President John Mahama .
In that speech , lines were lifted verbatim from United States Vice-president Al Gore 's 2000 presidential concession speech given after the US Supreme Court verdict .
Education sector In September 2017 , the president launched the Free Senior High School ( SHS ) policy , which will make secondary high school free for students in Ghana .
The president states it is a 'necessary investment in the nation 's future workforce ' and will help parents who are unable to pay for their children 's education due to financial hardships .
The program met with positive reaction from the nation , parents and students were excited and fervent , but private schools opposed to the program state it will decrease the number of students enrolling in their system .
Economy In 2018 , the president introduced the 7-year Co-ordinated Programme of Economic and Social Development Policies which is expected to create jobs for the country .
According to the president , the policies are founded on 'five pillars of growth and development , namely revitalizing the economy ; transform agriculture and industry ; revamping economic and social infrastructure ; strengthening social protection and inclusion ; and reforming delivery system of public services institutions .
After the pandemic , Ghana borrowed even more in comparison with its neighbours , precipitating a budget-deficit crisis , the second highest in Sub Saharan Africa at 16 % as of 2020 , far above the regional average of 6 % .
In November 2017 , he suggested that the legalisation of homosexuality is inevitable and said he can foresee a change in the law .
Akufo-Addo , who spent much of his early life in England , said that LGBT rights will evolve in Ghana as they have in the United Kingdom .
However , he affirmed that LGBT rights were not part of the government agenda at the moment .

Buildings include Accra and Cape Coast Sports Stadium and the Azumah Nelson Sports Complex in Kaneshie .
The University of Ghana Sports Stadium whose renovations were abandoned in 2009 after former President John Agyekum Kufuor left office will also proceed .
The new regions are Oti , Western North , North East , Ahafo ( splitting from Brong ) , Savannah and Bono East Regions .
The creation of the regions ends decades of petitions to the government calling for the development of new regions .

He joined other world leaders in the signing .
He wrote 'all people everywhere must have access to the vaccine when one becomes available . '
Concerns were raised that people in richer countries may have quicker access to the vaccine than poor countries which led to the writing of an open letter that any vaccine against the disease should be free and made available at no cost to all people .
In February 2021 , Ghana became the first African country to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the World Health Organization 's COVAX program .
The shipment consisted of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines .
